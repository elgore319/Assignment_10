# Part 1

## Did you use AI to help identify or fix the problem?

Yes

## What did AI get right or wrong?

It found the race condition and fakeWork problems

## Did you keep or change the AI suggestions?

I decided to come up with the solution on my own with minimal suggestions. The only suggestion I took from it was the "synchronized" keyword

# Part 2

## Submit your AI prompt and the returned code
    I did not use ai for this portion

# Part 3

## Ask AI for an architectural refactor suggestion
## Compare its recommendation to your final solution
## Was the AI overcomplicated, inaccurate, or helpful?

    Kind of overcomplicated, it wanted me to add AtomicInteger and get rid of the "sycronization" keyword, but for a project this small I didn't see a need to overcomplicate the changes.
